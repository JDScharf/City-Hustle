# City-Hustle
This game can be played at: https://connect.unity.com/p/city-hustle   
Video game demo that I built as part of Unity's Create with Code Course, using Prefab objects from Synty labs. Player runs across the screen and has to jump over city objects. Press space bar to jump and try not to hit one :)
